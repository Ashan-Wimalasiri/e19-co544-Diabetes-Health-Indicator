## Problem Overview

The rising epidemic of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases is a significant issue, particularly among adults. A key factor contributing to poor health outcomes is the lack of awareness and understanding about diabetes. Increasing awareness and education about diabetes can help improve health conditions and prevent the progression of these diseases.

## Solution

    We have implemented a machine learning model that predicts diabetes conditions (diabetes, no diabetes, pre-diabetes) based on various lifestyle features. This allows patients to check their diabetes status from home.
